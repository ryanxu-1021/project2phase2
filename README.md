I use the tweepy and google nlp to do this project.
First, get raw data by using twitter api. 
Then remove mention block, retweet block and embedded URLs.
Then send the treated data to google nlp. Using google nlp to analyze its sentiment.
Import the matplotlib. And using it to present the sentiment result in a diagram.
